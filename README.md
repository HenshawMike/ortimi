# ORTIMI

**ORTIMI** is a minimal, single-page mathematics tutoring website designed to convert exam-season pressure into booked one-on-one tutoring sessions.

The platform focuses on **mystery, authority, and clarity**, targeting students who struggle with mathematics and need focused, personal help before examinations.

---

## ✦ Concept

Most students don’t fail mathematics because they are incapable —  
they fail because they were taught to memorize instead of understand.

ORTIMI exists to fix that.

The site is intentionally minimal and dark-themed to project confidence, seriousness, and intellectual depth.
